- add way to view older version of tools in the web.
- improve tool creation init because it should have a full tool example SKILL.md example.
- refactor app to stop using supabase anon key and use something more straightforward.
- add subscription for private tools.

- we should probably only execute remote tools with --remote so I't not ambiguous when executing local tools.
- ensure --mount works.
